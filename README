What's MRPerf
-------------

MRPerf is a simulation tool to model Map/Reduce application performance on
large clusters. The current simulation mimics Hadoop, an open-source Map/Reduce
implementation.

Get Ready to Run MRPerf
-----------------------

To run simulation, ns-2 must be installed and patched. A patch is available in
ns.patch/, and it's against ns-2.34. The patch is not tested against other
versions of ns-2. Since xml configuration files are used in MRPerf, libxml2
must be available to compile patched ns-2. Once ns can be found and run from
command line, MRPerf is ready to run.

How to Run MRPerf
-----------------

MRPerf source files are in src/. Simple trail runs can be done within src/ dir.
To run high volumes of simulations, it's recommended to copy the source files
into a new dir and run simulations there. Run "make topo", "make gen", and
"make" in turn to run a simulation. The first two commands convert some
configuration files from .py or .xml to .tcl for ns-2 to read, and "make"
launches ns-2 on .tcl simulation files.

Disclaimer
----------

This is a pre-release/preview version of MRPerf. Some part of the code may not
work as expected. The authors will not provide support or bugfix of the code.
