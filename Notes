If OTcl does not compile, it's probably because it does not work with gcc-4.4.
Try install gcc-4.3 and compile OTcl with gcc-4.3.

patched ns-2 is dependent on libxml2, both headers and library. It is not
reflected in configure, and running make with libxml2 will cause some error
related to missing libxml headers or library. Headers are expected to be in
/usr/include/libxml2/, if libxml2 headers are installed elsewhere, please
modify Makefile.in to make it work.

Question: How to apply the ns-patch?
