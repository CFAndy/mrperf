If OTcl does not compile, it's probably because it does not work with gcc-4.4.
Try install gcc-4.3 and compile OTcl with gcc-4.3.

patched ns-2 is dependent on libxml2, both headers and library. It is not
reflected in configure, and running make with libxml2 will cause some error
related to missing libxml headers or library. Headers are expected to be in
/usr/include/libxml2/, if libxml2 headers are installed elsewhere, please
modify Makefile.in to make it work.

Question: How to apply the ns-patch?
Answer: ns-2.34 $ patch -p1 < /path/to/patch-ns-2.34


2010.8.3

A small patch on ns-2.34/tcp/tcp.cc was done in previous version of MRPerf, I
remember the reason why the original code will break, but doesn't seem to
understand what the patch is doing. I'll leave a copy of the patch in ns.patch/
dir.

Dr. Valetto informed me about a bug on rack groups with different machine
types. I fixed that on the v0.1 release, but haven't fixed it here. The patch
I gave him is in ns.patch/ dir.
